# bibleAPI

An angularJS application that calls the ESV Bible API to retrieve Bible verses.  

I wanted a way to easily copy-and-paste specific Bible verses and passages, because I was finding it more difficult to do with a lot of web-based Bibles.  This is a very basic use of an angular module and controller, however it does the job for me and I use this regularly.

Some notable things:
- extracting the relevant verse and passage from the API's XML response
- using the XMLHttpRequest object (instead of a separate ajax library)

Tech stack: angularjs, ESV Bible API
